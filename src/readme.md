Chuck Norris once ordered a steak in a restaurant. The steak did what it was told. 
Chuck Norris can sit in the corner of a round room. Chuck Norris can slam revolving doors. 
Chuck Norris beats rock, paper, scissors. Cannon balls, tanks, super destroyers, exploding stars — I could go on. 
If it looks like chicken, tastes like chicken, and feels like chicken but Chuck Norris says its beef, then it’s beef.
